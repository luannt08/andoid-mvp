Applocation based on MVP, Dagger2, RxJava, RxAndroid.

The MVP has populared and had tons tutorials, samples on internet. With my knowledge, I just have created this sample to demonstrate MVP basically.
It will help you know: how we create code base, what the layers do, and compound with RxJava,RxAndroid & Dagger2.
